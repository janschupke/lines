## Database Schema

### High Scores Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE high_scores (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  player_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  achieved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  game_duration INTEGER,
  balls_cleared INTEGER,
  turns_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
  individual_balls_popped INTEGER NOT NULL,
  lines_popped INTEGER NOT NULL,
  longest_line_popped INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_high_scores_score ON high_scores(score DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_high_scores_achieved_at ON high_scores(achieved_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_high_scores_turns ON high_scores(turns_count DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_high_scores_lines ON high_scores(lines_popped DESC);
```

## Vercel Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key for client access

### Deployment Instructions
1. Configure Supabase project and get connection details
2. Add environment variables to Vercel project settings
3. Deploy with automatic database migration
4. Verify high score functionality in production

## Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization
- Player names are automatically sanitized to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- Users can type any string without interruption during input
- When confirming (pressing enter or input losing focus), if anything in the input is considered invalid for any sanitization reason, the entire input value is converted into one eggplant emoji
- Maximum length limits prevent abuse
- Input validation ensures data integrity

### Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Prepared statements prevent SQL injection
- Rate limiting on high score submissions
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
