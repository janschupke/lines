# PRP-1703123456789-02-Reorganize-File-Structure

## Feature Overview

### Feature Name

Reorganize File Structure and Move Game Constants

### Brief Description

Reorganize the project file structure to improve maintainability and logical organization by moving game-related constants to the appropriate location and establishing clear file organization patterns.

### User Value

This refactoring will create a more intuitive file structure, improve code discoverability, establish clear separation of concerns, and make the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to have a logical and consistent file organization
**So that** I can easily find and maintain game-related code

### Additional User Stories

- **As a** developer, **I want** game constants to be in a logical location, **So that** I can easily find and modify game configuration
- **As a** developer, **I want** clear separation between game logic and utilities, **So that** I understand the purpose of each file
- **As a** new team member, **I want** intuitive file organization, **So that** I can quickly understand the codebase structure

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

## Code Examples

### Before (Current Structure)

```typescript
// src/utils/constants.ts
export const BOARD_SIZE = 9;
export const BALLS_PER_TURN = 3;
export type BallColor =
  | "red"
  | "green"
  | "blue"
  | "yellow"
  | "purple"
  | "cyan"
  | "black";
export const BALL_COLORS: BallColor[] = [
  "red",
  "green",
  "blue",
  "yellow",
  "purple",
  "cyan",
  "black",
];

// Import in game files
import { BOARD_SIZE, BALL_COLORS, type BallColor } from "../../utils/constants";
```

### After (Reorganized Structure)

```typescript
// src/game/constants.ts
export const BOARD_SIZE = 9;
export const BALLS_PER_TURN = 3;
export type BallColor =
  | "red"
  | "green"
  | "blue"
  | "yellow"
  | "purple"
  | "cyan"
  | "black";
export const BALL_COLORS: BallColor[] = [
  "red",
  "green",
  "blue",
  "yellow",
  "purple",
  "cyan",
  "black",
];

// Import in game files
import { BOARD_SIZE, BALL_COLORS, type BallColor } from "../constants";
```

### Updated File Structure

```
src/
├── game/
│   ├── logic/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── state/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── types/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── constants.ts (moved from utils)
├── utils/
│   ├── helpers.ts
│   ├── formatters.ts
│   ├── highScoreManager.ts
│   └── configManager.ts
└── ui/
    └── components/
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```typescript
// Test that constants are properly imported
import { BOARD_SIZE, BALL_COLORS, type BallColor } from "../game/constants";

describe("Game Constants", () => {
  it("should export BOARD_SIZE correctly", () => {
    expect(BOARD_SIZE).toBe(9);
  });

  it("should export BALL_COLORS correctly", () => {
    expect(BALL_COLORS).toHaveLength(7);
  });

  it("should export BallColor type correctly", () => {
    const color: BallColor = "red";
    expect(color).toBe("red");
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```typescript
// Test that game logic works with reorganized constants
import { BOARD_SIZE } from "../game/constants";
import { createEmptyBoard } from "../game/logic";

describe("Game Integration with Reorganized Constants", () => {
  it("should create board with correct size", () => {
    const board = createEmptyBoard();
    expect(board).toHaveLength(BOARD_SIZE);
    expect(board[0]).toHaveLength(BOARD_SIZE);
  });
});
```

## Constants Organization

### Game Configuration Constants

```typescript
// src/game/constants.ts
export const BOARD_SIZE = 9;
export const BALLS_PER_TURN = 3;
export const MIN_LINE_LENGTH = 5;
export const TIMER_INTERVAL = 1000;
```

### Game Types

```typescript
export type BallColor =
  | "red"
  | "green"
  | "blue"
  | "yellow"
  | "purple"
  | "cyan"
  | "black";
export type GameState = "idle" | "playing" | "paused" | "gameOver";
```

### Game Data

```typescript
export const BALL_COLORS: BallColor[] = [
  "red",
  "green",
  "blue",
  "yellow",
  "purple",
  "cyan",
  "black",
];
export const SCORING_TABLE: Record<number, number> = {
  5: 5,
  6: 8,
  7: 13,
  8: 21,
  9: 34,
};
```

### Animation Constants

```typescript
export const ANIMATION_DURATIONS = {
  MOVE_BALL: 80,
  POP_BALL: 300,
  TRANSITION: 200,
} as const;
```

This PRP ensures a well-organized, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns and intuitive file structure.
