## Feature: Enhanced High Score System - Game Statistics Tracking

### Overview
Extend the existing game state to track comprehensive statistics throughout gameplay, including detailed metrics for scoring, performance analysis, and enhanced high score evaluation. This phase implements the data collection infrastructure needed for the enhanced high score system.

### User Stories
- **As a** player, **I want** to see detailed game statistics, **So that** I can understand my performance beyond just the final score
- **As a** player, **I want** my high scores to include comprehensive game data, **So that** I can track my progress and compare achievements
- **As a** player, **I want** to see how many balls I cleared and lines I formed, **So that** I can understand my gameplay efficiency

      consecutiveHighScores: 0,
      strategicBonus: 0
    }));
  }, []);

  const recordTurn = useCallback(() => {
    setStatistics(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      turnsCount: prev.turnsCount + 1
    }));
  }, []);

  const recordLinePop = useCallback((length: number, score: number) => {

      const newTotalScore = prev.totalScore + score;
      const newScoreProgression = [...prev.scoreProgression, newTotalScore];

      // Calculate efficiency metrics
      const averageScorePerTurn = newTotalScore / (prev.turnsCount + 1);
      const linesPerTurn = (prev.linesPopped + 1) / (prev.turnsCount + 1);
      const ballsPerTurn = (prev.individualBallsPopped + length) / (prev.turnsCount + 1);

      // Track peak performance
      const peakScore = Math.max(prev.peakScore, score);
      
      // Calculate consecutive high scores (lines of 5+ balls)
      const consecutiveHighScores = length >= 5 ? prev.consecutiveHighScores + 1 : 0;

      // Strategic bonus for efficient play
      const strategicBonus = Math.floor(averageScorePerTurn * 0.1);

      return {

#### Fibonacci Scoring Implementation
```typescript
// Fibonacci sequence for scoring
const FIBONACCI_SEQUENCE = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610];

export const calculateLineScore = (lineLength: number): number => {
  if (lineLength < 5) return 0;
  
  // Use Fibonacci sequence for scoring
  const fibonacciIndex = Math.min(lineLength - 5, FIBONACCI_SEQUENCE.length - 1);
  return FIBONACCI_SEQUENCE[fibonacciIndex] * 100;
};

export const calculateBonusScore = (
  consecutiveHighScores: number,
  averageScorePerTurn: number,
  strategicBonus: number
): number => {
  let bonus = 0;
  
  // Bonus for consecutive high-scoring lines
  if (consecutiveHighScores >= 3) {
    bonus += consecutiveHighScores * 50;
  }
  
  // Efficiency bonus
  if (averageScorePerTurn > 100) {
    bonus += Math.floor(averageScorePerTurn * 0.2);
  }
  
  // Strategic bonus
  bonus += strategicBonus;
  
  return bonus;
};
```

### Code Examples

#### Statistics Tracker Implementation
```typescript
export class GameStatisticsTracker implements StatisticsTracker {
  private statistics: GameStatistics;
  private gameStartTime: number = 0;

  constructor() {
    this.statistics = this.getInitialStatistics();
  }

  startGame(): void {
    this.statistics = this.getInitialStatistics();
    this.gameStartTime = Date.now();
  }

  endGame(): GameStatistics {
    const finalStatistics = {
      ...this.statistics,
      gameDuration: Math.floor((Date.now() - this.gameStartTime) / 1000)
    };
    
    // Calculate final efficiency metrics
    finalStatistics.averageScorePerTurn = finalStatistics.totalScore / Math.max(finalStatistics.turnsCount, 1);
    finalStatistics.linesPerTurn = finalStatistics.linesPopped / Math.max(finalStatistics.turnsCount, 1);
    finalStatistics.ballsPerTurn = finalStatistics.individualBallsPopped / Math.max(finalStatistics.turnsCount, 1);
    
    return finalStatistics;
  }

  recordTurn(): void {
    this.statistics.turnsCount++;
  }

  recordLinePop(length: number, score: number): void {
    const lineScore: LineScore = {
      length,
      score,
      turnNumber: this.statistics.turnsCount,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    };

    this.statistics.linesPopped++;
    this.statistics.longestLinePopped = Math.max(this.statistics.longestLinePopped, length);
    this.statistics.individualBallsPopped += length;
    this.statistics.totalScore += score;
    this.statistics.scoreProgression.push(this.statistics.totalScore);
    this.statistics.lineScores.push(lineScore);
    this.statistics.peakScore = Math.max(this.statistics.peakScore, score);

    // Update consecutive high scores
    if (length >= 5) {
      this.statistics.consecutiveHighScores++;
    } else {
      this.statistics.consecutiveHighScores = 0;
    }

    // Calculate strategic bonus
    const currentAverage = this.statistics.totalScore / this.statistics.turnsCount;
    this.statistics.strategicBonus = Math.floor(currentAverage * 0.1);
  }

  recordBallPop(): void {
    this.statistics.ballsCleared++;
  }

  updateScore(newScore: number): void {
    this.statistics.totalScore = newScore;
  }

  getCurrentStatistics(): GameStatistics {
    return { ...this.statistics };
  }

  private getInitialStatistics(): GameStatistics {
    return {
      turnsCount: 0,
      gameDuration: 0,
      ballsCleared: 0,
      linesPopped: 0,
      longestLinePopped: 0,
      individualBallsPopped: 0,
      totalScore: 0,
      scoreProgression: [],
      lineScores: [],
      averageScorePerTurn: 0,
      ballsPerTurn: 0,
      linesPerTurn: 0,
      peakScore: 0,
      consecutiveHighScores: 0,
      strategicBonus: 0
    };
  }
}
```

#### Integration with Game Logic
```typescript
// Integrate with existing game state
export const useGameWithStatistics = () => {
  const gameState = useGameState(); // Existing game state
  const { statistics, startGame, recordTurn, recordLinePop, recordBallPop, updateGameDuration } = useGameStatistics();

  // Override game actions to include statistics tracking
  const makeMove = useCallback((from: Position, to: Position) => {
    const result = gameState.makeMove(from, to);
    
    if (result.success) {
      recordTurn();
      
      // Record any balls cleared during the move
      if (result.ballsCleared) {
        recordBallPop();
      }
      
      // Record any lines formed
      if (result.linesFormed) {
        result.linesFormed.forEach(line => {
          const score = calculateLineScore(line.length);
          recordLinePop(line.length, score);
        });
      }
      
      updateGameDuration(Math.floor((Date.now() - gameState.gameStartTime) / 1000));
    }
    
    return result;
  }, [gameState, recordTurn, recordBallPop, recordLinePop, updateGameDuration]);

  const startNewGame = useCallback(() => {
    gameState.startNewGame();
    startGame();
  }, [gameState, startGame]);

  return {
    ...gameState,
    statistics,
    makeMove,
    startNewGame
  };
};
```
