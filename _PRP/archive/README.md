## Completed PRPs

- **PRP-1752335049000-03-Production-Deployment-Configuration.md**: Implemented production deployment with Vercel and Supabase, including environment variable management, automated schema migrations, health checks, and deployment validation. Added production deployment and environment config services, with full test coverage. All tests and build pass.

- **PRP-1752335049000-02-Database-Schema-Migration-System.md**: Implemented a comprehensive database schema migration system with versioned up/down SQL scripts, automated migration runner, rollback support, schema validation, and performance checks. Includes migration file structure, migration service, schema manager, and extensive unit/integration tests. All tests and build pass.

- **PRP-1752335049000-01-Local-Development-Environment.md**: Modernized local development workflow. Docker Compose is now used only for the database (Supabase/Postgres), while the React/Vite app runs directly on the host for reliable hot reload and compatibility. README updated to explain this approach and the Vite/Node.js crypto.hash issue in containers. All tests and build pass.

- **PRP-1752330986000-03-Game-Statistics-Tracking.md**: Implemented comprehensive real-time game statistics tracking, including turns, balls cleared, lines popped, longest line, score progression, efficiency metrics, and performance analytics. Integrated Fibonacci-based scoring and bonus logic. All statistics are updated in real-time and integrated with the high score system. All tests and build pass.

- **PRP-1752330986000-02-Database-Integration.md**: Integrated Supabase for persistent high score storage, including secure database schema, connection status monitoring, retry logic, and robust error handling. High scores are now saved and loaded from the cloud, with user feedback for connection issues and graceful offline fallback. All tests and build pass.

- **PRP-1752330986000-01-UI-Foundation.md**: Implemented the foundational UI for the enhanced high score system, including a High Score button with keyboard shortcut, a responsive and accessible overlay displaying top scores and detailed statistics, and a player name input modal with validation. Extended game state to track turns, balls cleared, lines popped, and more. All tests and build pass.

- **PRP-1703123456789-05-Mobile-Optimization.md**: Mobile optimization with enhanced touch controls and responsive design. Implemented touch-friendly ball selection and movement, swipe gestures, larger touch targets, mobile-specific controls, and improved responsive layout. Ensured accessibility and performance on mobile devices. All tests and build pass.
